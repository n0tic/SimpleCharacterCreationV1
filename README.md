# SimpleCharacterCreationV1 2D
A very simple pixelart type character creation with presets. Created to show how simple it would be to make a customizable system. This was completed in about 20 minutes and the most time-consuming thing was actually converting the images from gimp to photoshop files and then modify the art to what I needed(presets).

Save-load functionallity was thrown in from another project and stripped down. I will update it tomorrow and clean up some code.

Remove Assets/Plugins folder.
