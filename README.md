# SimpleCharacterCreationV1 Unity 2D
A very simple pixelart type character creation with presets. Created to show how simple it would be to make a customizable preset based system. This was completed in about 20 minutes and the most time-consuming thing was actually converting the images from gimp to photoshop files and then modify the art to what I needed(presets).

WebGL working save-system + Binary Save File for standalone builds.
